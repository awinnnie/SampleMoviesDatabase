# SampleMoviesDatabase
SQL Database that stores movies, actors and crew members, TV shows, and awards. Some data is inserted, and queries, views, and functions are written based on it. The data is generated using Python, with Faker, and some Kaggle datasets. 

The project was developed in collaboration with a classmate at the American University of Armenia - Nane Khachatryan.
